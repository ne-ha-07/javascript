<!-- We are going to study flexbox and grid.

Flexbox - full name - Flexible Box Layout. A 1D CSS layout model designed for arranging items within a container in a 
flexible and responsive manner. Aligns items space along a single axis(either horizontally as a row or vice versa).
By default sare items vertical(columns me) hote h. And to change that, we target parent container and display : flex.
key concepts : 
1. Flex Container - parent element is display
2. Flex Items - direct children of a flex container
3. Main axis - primary axis along which flex items are laid out. eg row column
4.Cross axis - axis perpendicular to the main axis.

main flexbox properties : 
display, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, align-content, flex-wrap etc.

Grid - a 2D layout system that allows for the arrangement of content into rows and columns.
It provides a powerful and flexible way to create complex and responsive web page layouts.
key concepts :
1. Grid Container - parent element with display : grid or inline grid.
2. Grid Items - direct children of container.
3. Grid Lines - horizontal & vertical lines defining the structure of grid. They are numbered starting from 1.
4. Grid Tracks - space b/w 2 grid lines, forming rows and columns of grid
5. Grid Cells - individual unit of grid. Formed by intersection of a row track and a column track.
6. Grid Areas - defined using grid-template areas property. It is the named area within the grid.

NOTE : Flexbox is best for 1D layouts whereas Grid is best for 2D layouts(handling row and column simultaneously). -->
